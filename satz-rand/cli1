Hi, Henry,

	Below you will find the new version of Satz which consumes less memory than 
the IJCAI'97 version. I've modified the main() function by using a function 
dpl() which executes the tree search. You may easily modify dpl() to interrupt 
it,
e.g. when NB_BACK (nb of backtracking) becomes large, stop the loop. Then you 
may simply recall this function to restart Satz. Each call of this function 
resets the initial input formula before starting a new tree search so that no 
more memory is needed. The same function (with the reset_all() function) can 
be used in the IJCAI'97 version after deleting the line containing test_flag[].

	If you have any question about the program, do not hesitate to contact me.

	Best regards

	Chu Min
