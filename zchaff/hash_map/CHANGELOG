           Delete wasn't decrementing currentLength when it removed
           things from the hash table.  Thanks Bill.

1/12/2001  I discovered an obscure bug with the InsertWithoutDuplication
           function.  The file regress_1.cpp should demonstrate this bug.
           I fixed the bug and put a discussion in the comments 
           section of my_hash_map.H.  (EM)

1/13/2001  In the process of writing more comprehensive regression
           tests I found and fixed other bugs in insert and delete
           which can crop up if you repeatedly insert and delete
           things with the same key.  (EM)

6/17/2001  I made my_hash_map look a little more like hash_map.
           Now the hash functor you give it must have it's hash
           function be operator()(key) instead of Hash(key).
           Also, if you make your hash functor inherit from
           MyHasherModel then you only need to define 1 hash
           function not 2.
